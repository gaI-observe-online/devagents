# Approved change plans

Change plans are the **execution authorization** boundary.

## Rules
- Execution must be bounded by an **approved** `CHANGE-###-<suffix>.yaml`.
- The plan should include a **file allowlist**, **test plan**, and **rollback plan**.
- VDA approval is required before execution begins.

## Start here
Use `/gados-project/templates/CHANGE.template.yaml`.
