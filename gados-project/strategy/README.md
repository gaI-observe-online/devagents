# Strategy (Epics)

This folder contains **strategic epic plans** (`EPIC-###.md`).

## Rules
- Epics must align with `/gados-project/memory/FOUNDATION.md`.
- Epic plans should cite **usage/cost data** when making economic or architecture recommendations.
- Epics are planning artifacts: they do **not** certify verification truth.

## Start here
Use `/gados-project/templates/EPIC.template.md`.

## Beta docs
- Runbook: `BETA_RUNBOOK.md`
- Scope freeze + acceptance gates: `BETA_SCOPE.md`

## Strategic game plan (HTML)
