# FOUNDATION (Authoritative Memory)

**Status**: Authoritative / Immutable-by-default  
**Purpose**: Vision, mission, values, and non-negotiables for GADOS.

## Mission
Build a governed agentic delivery operating system where **AI velocity** is preserved while **truth, auditability, architectural integrity, economic control, and human authority** are enforced.

## Problem statement
AI coding tools increase speed but often degrade:
- **Governance** (who can do what, and when)
- **Truth** (features declared “done” without evidence)
- **Economic control** (pricing/architecture decided on vibes, not usage data)

## Solution statement
GADOS is a **five-agent, separation-of-powers** delivery system that:
- Prevents any single agent from planning, executing, verifying, and approving its own work
- Governs through **versioned artifacts**, not chat memory
- Requires **evidence-backed verification** before certification
- Anchors pricing and architecture decisions in **real usage + cost data**
- Keeps **humans accountable** for irreversible, ethical, and economic decisions

## Core values (non-negotiable)
- **Truth over speed**: nothing is “done” until verified with evidence.
- **Artifacts over memory**: artifacts are the source of truth; chat is not.
- **Separation of powers**: checks and balances prevent drift.
- **Economics first**: margin and cost visibility at feature level.
- **Human authority**: humans decide risk, ethics, pricing, and irreversible actions.
- **Audit-ready always**: decisions and evidence are traceable and defensible.

## Definition of “Verified”
A story may be marked `VERIFIED` only when:
- Acceptance criteria are satisfied **with evidence**
- Evidence is attached in `/gados-project/verification/`
- Decision and rationale are recorded in the story audit log
- The verifier is **not** the implementer (independence)

## Authorities
- **Human Authority**: final authority over escalation outcomes, ethics, pricing, irreversible decisions.
- **Delivery Governor (VDA)**: final authority over verification and certification of truth.
