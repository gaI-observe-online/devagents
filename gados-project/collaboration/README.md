# Collaboration Hub (repo-tracked)

This folder is the **shared coordination hub** for all contributors (humans + agents).

## Rules (merge-clean)
- Prefer **append-only** updates for logs (`HANDOFF.md`, `DECISIONS.md`).
- Keep `STATUS.md` short and current (edit in place).
- Every update should link to evidence artifacts where applicable (logs, verification packages, CI runs).
- If it's not in an artifact, it doesn't exist.

## Files
- `STATUS.md`: shared status board (workstreams, blockers, QA snapshot)
- `HANDOFF.md`: append-only handoff log (use the template inside)
- `DECISIONS.md`: append-only decision log (audit-friendly)
- `GUIDELINES.md`: collaboration rules + evidence standards + observability expectations
- `BETA_SCENARIOS.md`: how to run the 5 beta scenarios + what evidence to review
