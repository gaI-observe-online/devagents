## Collaboration hub (shared)

This folder is the **single shared place** for coordination across humans and agents.

### Use this for

- **Current status** (what’s in progress, blocked, done): `STATUS.md`
- **Handoffs** between agents/reviewers: `HANDOFF.md`
- **Decisions log** (audit-friendly): `DECISIONS.md`
- **Async messages** when DM isn’t possible: `INBOX.md`

### Update rules (keep merges clean)

- Prefer **append-only** entries (especially for decisions and daily logs).
- When updating `STATUS.md`, only touch the sections you own (one intent/workstream per row).
- Include a **date + owner + link** (PR/commit/file path) on every update.
