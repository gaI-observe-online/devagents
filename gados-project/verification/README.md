# Verification (Evidence + Peer Review)

This folder contains independent inputs used by the Delivery Governor (VDA) to certify truth:

- `STORY-###-evidence.md` (QA evidence package)
- `STORY-###-review.md` (peer review report)

## Rules
- Evidence must map explicitly to acceptance criteria.
- The implementer must not author the verification decision.

## Start here
- Evidence: `/gados-project/templates/VERIFICATION_EVIDENCE.template.md`
- Peer review: `/gados-project/templates/PEER_REVIEW.template.md`
